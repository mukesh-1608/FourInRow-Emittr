You are a senior frontend + backend engineer.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Backend logic is ALREADY CORRECT and MUST NOT be changed
- Backend is written in PURE GOLANG
- WebSocket protocol and message formats MUST remain unchanged
- Your task is to FIX UI BUGS and IMPROVE THE FRONTEND EXPERIENCE ONLY

--------------------------------
PROBLEMS TO FIX (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------

1) GAME OVER STATE PERSISTS AFTER REFRESH
- Currently, after a game ends and the page is refreshed, the UI still shows:
  "Game Over! Winner: cpu"
- This happens because the frontend reconnects to an already-finished game

FIX REQUIRED:
- When a `game_over` WebSocket message is received:
  - Disable board interaction
  - Show game result clearly
  - Show a "New Game" button
- When the user clicks "New Game":
  - Close the existing WebSocket connection
  - Reset ALL frontend state (board, status, turn, winner)
  - Start a FRESH game session by reconnecting
- Do NOT auto-reconnect to a finished game

--------------------------------

2) INCORRECT CLICK BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL BUG)
- Clicking one circle sometimes places a disc in another column
- This is a UI bug, NOT a backend bug

FIX REQUIRED:
- Input MUST be column-based, not cell-based
- Users click a COLUMN, not individual cells
- The frontend must:
  - Attach click handlers ONLY to columns
  - Send the column index (0–6) to the backend
- The backend already handles gravity correctly

--------------------------------

3) INPUT SHOULD BE DISABLED WHEN:
- It is NOT the player’s turn
- The game is over
- The WebSocket is disconnected

Provide visual feedback when input is disabled

--------------------------------
UI / UX IMPROVEMENTS (REQUIRED)
--------------------------------

Improve the UI so that it feels like a real Connect Four game.
DO NOT use heavy frameworks.
HTML + CSS + JS only (React is optional but not required).

REQUIRED UI IMPROVEMENTS:

1) GAME BOARD
- 7 columns x 6 rows
- Rounded board container
- Dark blue board background
- Circular holes with depth (shadows)

2) DISCS
- Red and Yellow discs
- Use gradients for a 3D look
- Clear visual distinction between players

3) HOVER PREVIEW (VERY IMPORTANT)
- When hovering over a column:
  - Show a semi-transparent preview disc above the column
  - Color should match the current player
- This preview should disappear if input is disabled

4) DROP ANIMATION
- When a disc is placed:
  - Animate it falling from the top into the correct row
- Animation should apply ONLY to the newly placed disc

5) TURN INDICATORS
- Display:
  - "Your Turn"
  - "Bot Thinking..."
  - "Waiting for Opponent"
- Clearly indicate whose turn it is

6) GAME OVER UI
- Show:
  - Winner (or Draw)
  - A clear "New Game" button
- Board should visually appear disabled

--------------------------------
ARCHITECTURE RULES
--------------------------------

- DO NOT modify backend game logic
- DO NOT change WebSocket message formats
- DO NOT add authentication
- DO NOT add persistence logic
- Keep frontend code clean and readable
- Add comments explaining UI decisions
- Focus on correctness first, visuals second

--------------------------------
FINAL CHECKLIST
--------------------------------

After changes, verify:
- Clicking always places discs in the correct column
- Bot moves are reflected correctly
- Game can be restarted cleanly after game over
- UI feels responsive and intuitive
- Hover + animation work smoothly
- No backend changes were required

When finished:
- STOP
- Summarize what was changed in the frontend only
